# CST213 Short Assignment Week 4
## Objective:

Build a Faces application.

## Activity Directions:

Create a decision support system, implemented as a Faces application that advises the user on the choice of an item to purchase. You will ask the user several questions (using a webpage for each). Upon receiving the answer, your application will decide which question to ask next. You are free to choose the context of the purchase, the questions, and the decision tree structure. However, you must meet the following requirements:

* At least 15 questions.
* A binary decision tree with at least 3 levels (the tree does not need to be fully balanced).
* Upon reaching a terminal node, the application produces an answer and explains the decision to the user.
* All user answers are yes/no.

Design the GUI using any tool or technology you deem appropriate and explain your choice in the documentation. Also explain the use of XHTML in your application.
